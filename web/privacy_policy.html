    <h1>RosterFlow Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to RosterFlow. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect from our users ("you", "user", "manager", "employee"), why we collect it, how we use and protect it, and your rights over your data. By creating an account in our Application, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
    <p>For any questions about this policy or your data, you can contact us at: info@rosterflowapp.com.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the information strictly necessary for the application's operation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Information you provide to us directly:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration and Profile Data:</strong> Your full name, email address, password, and, optionally, a profile picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Authentication:</strong> If you register through a provider like Google, we collect an authentication token and basic profile data (email and name) to facilitate registration.</li>
                <li><strong>Communications with us:</strong> If you contact our support team, we will save the content of that communication.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information you generate while using the App:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organization Data:</strong> Information about the company, schedules, shifts, templates, and announcements that managers and owners create.</li>
                <li><strong>Request Data:</strong> Time-off or shift-change requests that employees generate.</li>
                <li><strong>Clock-in/out Data:</strong> The clock-in and clock-out times you record.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Information we collect automatically:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect basic data about your device, such as the model and operating system, to diagnose errors and improve compatibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Location Information (GPS):</strong> Only if your organization's administrator activates this feature and you grant explicit permission, we collect your GPS location at the precise moment of clocking in and/or out. This information is used exclusively to verify that the clock-in is performed at the workplace.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How and Why We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We process your data to execute the service we offer you (our "contract" with you):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To create and manage your account and profile.</li>
        <li>To allow managers to create and assign schedules and shifts.</li>
        <li>To allow employees to view their schedules, clock in, and manage their requests.</li>
        <li>To show managers the clock-in status, including location on a map if the feature is active.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> To maintain a free plan, we display ads through our partner Google AdMob. Google may use an advertising identifier from your device to show you more relevant ads based on your activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. With Whom We Share Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Other Users in your Organization:</strong> Your name, role, and schedules are visible to other members of your team, according to the permissions set (for example, a manager can see their team's schedules).</li>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use trusted providers who help us operate, such as Supabase (for all backend infrastructure) and Google AdMob (to serve ads in the application).</li>
        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> If required by law or to protect the safety of our users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights Over Your Data</h2>
    <p>You have control over your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access and Rectify:</strong> You can access and edit your profile information (name, photo) at any time from the Application settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Right of Erasure ("Right to be Forgotten"):</strong> You can request the deletion of your account from the app settings. This action is permanent and irreversible and will delete all your personal data associated with your profile.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We keep your data as long as your account and your memberships to organizations are active. If you delete your account, your personal data will be erased.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended for children under 16. We do not knowingly collect information from minors.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to this Policy</h2>
    <p>We may modify this Policy. We will notify you of any significant changes through the Application or by other means.</p>
