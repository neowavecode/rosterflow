    <h1>RosterFlow Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") constitute a binding legal agreement between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("you", "the client") and RosterFlow ("we", "us", "our") concerning your access to and use of the RosterFlow mobile application (the "Service").</p>
    <p>By creating an account, the user with the <strong>'owner'</strong> role accepts these terms on behalf of the entire organization they represent. It is the 'owner's' responsibility to ensure that all users ('managers' and 'employees') invited to their organization comply with these terms.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Service Description</h2>
    <p>RosterFlow is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses manage their team schedules, track worked hours via a clock-in system, handle time-off requests, and communicate efficiently.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts and Roles</h2>
    <p>The Service distinguishes three types of user roles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Has full control over the organization. Is responsible for the subscription, billing, and inviting other 'owners' and 'managers'.</li>
        <li><strong>Manager:</strong> Manages the daily operations of one or more locations, including creating schedules and managing employees assigned to those locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Employee:</strong> Uses the application to view their schedules, clock their work hours, and submit requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and for all activity that occurs under your account.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You are solely responsible for the conduct and data (schedules, employee information, etc.) that you create or transmit through the Service.</p>

    <h2>5. User Content</h2>
    <p>All information that you and the members of your organization enter into the application (employee data, schedules, announcements, etc.) is your property ("User Content"). You grant us a limited license to use, process, and display this User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service.</p>

    <h2>6. Subscriptions and Payments (Coming Soon)</h2>
    <p>Access to RosterFlow will be based on a subscription. We will offer a free trial period, after which the organization's 'owner' must select a payment plan to continue using the Service. Details on plans, pricing, and billing cycles will be specified at the time this functionality is implemented.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service and delete your account at any time. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you severely violate these Terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is". We do not guarantee that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free. To the maximum extent permitted by law, RosterFlow will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service.</p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the application. Your continued use of the Service after such changes will constitute your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
